Instructions to run:
  valgrind --leak-check=full ./mazes
  OR
  ./mazes

Note: Mazes code works (performs functions necessary) and all allocs are freed
however running on some occasions brings forth errors even though the performance is
correct. I spent over 24 hours trying to debug the program so it has no errors always
but the errors, if they come up were not helpful to debug it is always invalid read of sizeof 4
at one line(cleanUpGraphRecursive) but I debugged that function many times. So if errors come
up upon running I did my best.
